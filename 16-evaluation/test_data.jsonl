It is a massive storm on Jupiter, so large that Earth could fit inside it."}
{"query":"Why is a day on Venus longer than its year?","ground_truth":"Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun, making its day longer than its year.","context":"A day on Venus is longer than its year! Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun.","response":"A day on Venus is longer than its year because Venus takes about 243 Earth days to complete one full rotation on its axis (a Venus day), while it only takes about 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun (a Venus year). This means Venus spins very slowly relative to its orbital period, making its day longer than its year."}
{"query":"How much of the solar system's mass does the Sun contain?","ground_truth":"The Sun contains 99.86% of all mass in our solar system.","context":"The Sun contains 99.86% of all mass in our solar system.","response":"The Sun contains 99.86% of all the mass in our solar system."}
{"query":"How fast does the International Space Station travel?","ground_truth":"The ISS travels at about 17,500 mph and completes one orbit every 90 minutes.","context":"The International Space Station travels at about 17500 mph completing one orbit around Earth every 90 minutes.","response":"The International Space Station (ISS) travels at about 17,500 miles per hour (mph), completing one orbit around Earth approximately every 90 minutes. \n\nSource: fact-014 from the space facts knowledge base."}
{"query":"What happens to astronauts' height in space?","ground_truth":"Astronauts grow up to 2 inches taller in space because there is no gravity compressing their spines.","context":"Astronauts grow up to 2 inches taller in space because there is no gravity compressing their spines.","response":"Astronauts grow up to 2 inches taller in space because there is no gravity compressing their spines. The microgravity environment in space allows the spine to stretch out, resulting in an increase in height during their time in orbit (Source: fact-012)."}
